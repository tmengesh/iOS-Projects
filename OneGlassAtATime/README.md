## OneGlassAtATime
OneGlassAtATime is a single view app developed to learn the use of Core Graphics. The app is done based on a tutorial
on www.raywenderlich.com   

The app is designed to track user's water drinking habits.
Specifically, it makes it easy to track how much water you drink. “They” tell us that drinking eight glasses of water a day 
is healthy, but it’s easy to lose track after a few glasses. This is where OneGlassAtATime comes in; every time you polish 
off a refreshing glass of water, tap the counter. You’ll also see a graph of your previous seven days’ consumption. When the 
user reaches 8 glass a day the app rewards him/her virtual meda.
